# HELP!
Tonight I used LetGo to sell my mid 2014 MAcbook Pro. I've sold tons of stuff online never with an issue, this was the second time I had used letgo. Upon meeting with the person and spending some time showing them the laptop, they then reached into their pocket to get what I assumed was the money, so I started to hand over the mac, they grabbed it and ran. My macbook is gone. Ive filed a police report and given the serial number etc, my question for you is, what kind of data do you have access to? Do you have location data for the letgo user stored in your database from the last time they accessed the app? I really want to try to get any data I can even if its a general area. The users name was benjamin.p but he changed it, shortly after stealing my mac, to josue.p  

And then blocked me...  

If there is __ANYTHING__ you can do or offer in the way of data from the app i'd love to get in contact you with. BTW, he was using a white LG phone, hence me reaching out to you (android guy).  

Thanks,
Jason
